# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used the terminal-table gem to make a good looking table. 

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1 is the all_professional_looking_table method which prints out a table
  b) Feature 2 is the filter_by_priority method which allows the user to view items by indicating a priority

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I tried to slow down and enjoy the process this time instead of "sprinting" through it. I put good music on the headphones and tried to make it
fun over a five day period versus "get this done now"

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Using the terminal-table gem and learning how to use it and successfully printing out the various items was rewarding.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I built the professional table output for aesthetics. I built the filter by priority for usability enhancement.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
In various ways - learning the actual Ruby language. I can tell you I enjoy the Ruby community on the Internet (and on Udacity!). 
The many contributors out there don't seem to be as old-school jaded as you might find in other languages. Enjoying it!
